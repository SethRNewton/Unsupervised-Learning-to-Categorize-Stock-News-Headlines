Stocks frequently see quick price movements after following big news. However, looking at many news headlines, many editorial and opinion type articles are mixed in with news on actual events. For example, an article titled “Five Stocks to Include in Your Retirement Portfolio” is unlikely to cause a price movement whereas articles reporting significant events about a company such as a new product offering, a change in an important leadership role, or recent earnings reportings are far more likely to trigger significant price movements. 

In this project, I will explore various unsupervised learning techniques to cluster stock news headlines in an attempt to separate editorial and opinion articles from event-driven articles.

This project demonstrates my ability to use various unsupervised learning techniques to gain insights about text data and includes several visualization to help the reader understand the results. It also includes key findings from the results, possible flaws, and ideas for improvement in future projects.

The Jupyter Notebook included is well annotated with markdown cells so the reader should be able to follow along but a full report detailing the problem, data, methods, and results is also provided. The raw data is provided in a csv file.
